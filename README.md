# Note Taker Starter Code

## Thing to say

I still learning and fixing the professional READNE challenge so there will not be having a good readme.

## How the aassigment getting done

I restart the whole module with the file challenge have given me.

At lesson one, I can create a port and path the API to db.json file

At lesson two, I update app.post so I can push new data to the database

At lesson three, I connect the backend with front end together.

## Feature

I really want to create the front end to see how this match together.

The script file that I download beyond my knowlegde, which make me eager to learn.
